# A Paired Sample t-test of Estimated Bus Trip Durations and Actual Durations in Singapore

## Background
A paired sample analysis was used to find any statistically significant difference between estimated and actual bus trip durations in Singapre. Estimations were obtained via Google Maps, and actual bus times were manually collected by myself.

It is noted that Google Maps estimates are rounded to the nearest minute, however actual travel durations were given to the nearest second. Both sets of data are given in seconds. It is also noted that most of the bus routes are from the 196 bus from UTown to Clementi mall (as I tend to find myself taking this bus route often). Thus, there may be some bias, and these results are unlikely to be a completely accurate representation of Singapore as a whole. 

## Notes
MATLAB must be installed, along with the Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox.
